Your task is to generate a comprehensive and accurate technical wiki page in Markdown format about a specific feature, system, or module within a given software project.

{language_instruction}

You will be given:
1. The "[WIKI_PAGE_TOPIC]" for the page you need to create: "{}"
2. A list of "[RELEVANT_SOURCE_FILES]" from the project that you MUST use as the sole basis for the content.

CRITICAL STARTING INSTRUCTION:
The very first thing on the page MUST be a `<details>` block listing ALL the `[RELEVANT_SOURCE_FILES]` you used to generate the content.
Format it exactly like this:

<details>
<summary>üìÅ Source Files</summary>

The following files were used as context for generating this wiki page:

{}

</details>

Immediately after the `<details>` block, the main title of the page should be a H1 Markdown heading: `# {}`

Based ONLY on the content of the `[RELEVANT_SOURCE_FILES]`:

## üìã Content Structure Requirements

### 1. **Introduction Section**
Start with a concise introduction (1-2 paragraphs) explaining:
- The purpose and scope of "{}"
- High-level overview within the project context
- Key relationships to other components (if evident from source files)

### 2. **Detailed Technical Sections**
Break down "{}" into logical sections using H2 (`##`) and H3 (`###`) Markdown headings:
- Explain architecture, components, data flow, or logic
- Identify key functions, classes, data structures, API endpoints
- Document configuration elements and their purposes

### 3. **Mermaid Diagrams (CRITICAL FORMATTING)**
EXTENSIVELY use Mermaid diagrams to visually represent:
- System architecture and component relationships
- Data flow and process sequences
- Class hierarchies and dependencies

**STRICT Mermaid Requirements:**
- ALWAYS use `graph TD` (top-down) directive for flow diagrams
- NEVER use `graph LR` (left-right) orientation
- Maximum node width should be 3-4 words
- For sequence diagrams:
  ```
  sequenceDiagram
      participant A as ComponentA
      participant B as ComponentB
      A->>B: Request
      B-->>A: Response
  ```
- Use descriptive but concise names
- Include activation boxes with +/- notation where relevant

### 4. **Structured Information Tables**
Use Markdown tables to organize:
- Key features/components and descriptions
- API endpoints, parameters, types, descriptions
- Configuration options, types, default values
- Data model fields, types, constraints

Example format:
| Component | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Feature A | Core functionality | ‚úÖ Active |
| Feature B | Optional module | üöß Development |

### 5. **Code Examples (When Relevant)**
Include SHORT, relevant code snippets from the source files:
- Use proper language identifiers in code blocks
- Focus on key implementation patterns
- Highlight important configuration examples

### 6. **Source Citations (MANDATORY)**
For EVERY significant piece of information, you MUST cite the specific source file(s):
- Use format: `Sources: [filename.ext:line_range]()`
- Example: `Sources: [main.rs:45-67](), [config.rs:12]()`
- Cite at least 3-5 different source files throughout the page

### 7. **Navigation and Links**
- Link to related wiki pages using format: `[Page Name](./page-name.md)`
- Include "See Also" section if relevant
- Add navigation hints for next steps

## üéØ Quality Standards

{}

### Technical Accuracy
- Base ALL information on provided source files
- Do not infer or invent details not present in the code
- If crucial information is missing, explicitly state its absence

### Clarity and Structure
- Use clear, professional technical language
- Maintain logical information flow
- Include practical examples where possible

### Completeness
- Cover all major aspects evident in the source files
- Ensure comprehensive documentation of the topic
- Balance detail with readability

## üéØ Page Planning Guidelines

### Importance Levels:
- **critical**: Must-read pages (Overview, Getting Started, Installation)
- **high**: Important for most users (Architecture, API Reference, Configuration)
- **medium**: Useful but not essential (Examples, Advanced Topics, Deployment)
- **low**: Supplementary content (FAQ, Troubleshooting, Contributing)

### Content Focus Areas:
- **Getting Started**: Installation, setup, first steps
- **Architecture**: System design, components, data flow
- **API/Reference**: Detailed technical documentation
- **Guides**: Step-by-step tutorials and examples
- **Configuration**: Settings, options, customization
- **Development**: Contributing, building, testing

### File Relevance:
- Identify the most important files for each page
- Include configuration files, main entry points, core modules
- Consider test files for understanding usage patterns
- Include documentation files (README, CHANGELOG, etc.)

## üìä Quality Criteria

1. **Logical Organization**: Pages should follow a natural learning progression
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All major aspects of the project should be documented
3. **Balanced Scope**: Each page should have a focused, manageable scope
4. **Clear Relationships**: Related pages should be properly linked
5. **Practical Value**: Each page should provide actionable information

### Usage Questions (3-4 questions)  
4. Who is the primary target audience for this project?
5. What are the main use cases and user workflows?
6. How does this project compare to similar solutions?

### Technical Questions (3-4 questions)
7. What are the key dependencies and why were they chosen?
8. What are the performance characteristics and limitations?
9. How is error handling and logging implemented?
